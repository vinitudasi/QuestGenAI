## 🧠 How It Works

![total system](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a972a4ec-632e-4c6c-a2e4-fdcfd624fd83)



QuestGen-AI employs a sophisticated multi-agent system powered by LangChain and large language models:

1. **Extractor Agent**: Analyzes your input requirements to understand the exam type, total marks, question types, and subject areas

2. **Question Creator Agent**: Generates appropriate questions based on the extracted requirements and the content of the uploaded PDFs

3. **Question Analysis Agent**: Evaluates the generated questions for quality, clarity, relevance, and alignment with requirements

4. **Decider Agent**: Determines if the questions meet all requirements or need further refinement

5. **Formatter Agent**: Arranges the questions into a professionally formatted exam paper with clear sections and instructions

This multi-step process ensures high-quality, relevant questions that align with your specific needs and content.

     - Example: "University of Technology - Midterm Examination - CS101: Introduction to Programming - Spring 2023"

   - **Question Description**: Provide instructions and parameters for the question paper
     - Example: "Create a question paper with 5 multiple-choice questions (2 marks each), 3 short-answer questions (5 marks each), and 1 essay question (10 marks). Focus on Python basics and data structures."

4. **Enter API Key**

   Provide your OpenRouter API key in the designated field. This is used to access the AI models that power the question generation.

5. **Select Model (Optional)**

   Choose the AI model to use for generation. The default is "qwen/qwq-32b:free".

6. **Generate Questions**

   Click the "Generate Question Paper" button to start the process. The system will:

- Uploaded PDF files are securely stored in Convex and automatically deleted once question generation is complete
- No user data is retained between sessions
- API keys are transmitted securely but should still be protected carefully

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- User accounts for saving and organizing generated question papers
- Additional question formats and customization options
- Pre-built templates for common exam types
- Batch generation of multiple question papers
- Integration with learning management systems
- Offline mode using local models
